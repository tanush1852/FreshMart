3. Calculate estimated delivery time based on:
   - Distance between locations
   - Current traffic conditions
   - Store preparation time
   - Courier availability

### Dual User Roles
The system supports two distinct user types:
- **Store Owners**: Can manage inventory, update store details, and process orders
- **Customers**: Can browse products, place orders, and track deliveries
